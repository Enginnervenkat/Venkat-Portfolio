The `/github-portfolio/github-portfolio/src/assets` directory is intended for storing images, icons, or other assets used in the application. Since you did not specify any particular assets to include, I will create the directory structure and leave it empty.

Here are the contents for the `/github-portfolio/github-portfolio/src/assets` directory:

# /github-portfolio/github-portfolio/src/assets
# This directory is intentionally left blank.
